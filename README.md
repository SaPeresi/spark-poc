# spark-poc

This project will test intersections and interactions between GenevaERS and Apache Spark. When complete, this repo will include the following:

- An overview of the POC (here in this document)
- Source data assets, including links to publicly available data files and scripts to convert them into appropriate formats
- Spark code to produce a baseline output
- Spark code leveraging jzos, the z/OS java IO routines
- Spark code leveraging genlib, GenevaERS encapsulated utlities to perform GenevaERS function in a stand alone mode
- GenevaERS XML defining GenevaERS processes to produce the same outputs.

This project has been built with the hope that others can download, run, and analyze the outputs.  This will give a sense of GenevaERS capabilities, and how they compare to the more well-known Apache Spark capabilities.  

Here is the framework being considered for the next generation GenevaERS.

This outlines the Spark POC approach

And this starts to describe what will be learned from this POC
