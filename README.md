# spark-poc

This project will test intersections and interactions between GenevaERS and Apache Spark. This repo includes the following:

- An overview of the POC (here in this document)
- Source data assets, including links to publicly available data files and scripts to convert them into appropriate formats
- Spark code to produce a baseline output
- Spark code leveraging jzos, the z/OS java IO routines
- Spark code leveraging genlib, GenevaERS encapsulated utlities to perform GenevaERS function in a stand alone mode
- GenevaERS XML defining GenevaERS processes to produce the same outputs.

This project has been built with the hope that others can download, run, and analyze the outputs.  This will give a sense of GenevaERS capabilities, and how they compare to the more well-known Apache Spark capabilities.
